# Retail Industry- Product assortment Optimization
The VP and the Category Manager of an Organic Grocery Retail Company wanted to work on a strategy of targeting shelf locations by giving more space to high margin cereals, setting dynamic pricing based on health-oriented products, and maximizing profits. 
They assume that customers buy what they know. So they could work effectively with other stakeholders such as the Marketing team and Pricing Team to achieve their target. 
From the Customer Survey/ feedback, they already have data that provide the preferred nutrients from customers. So, they are looking to consider that in their pricing and selling strategies.
